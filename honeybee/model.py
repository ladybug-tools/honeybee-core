        rooms: A list of Room objects in the model.
        orphaned_faces: A list of the Face objects in the model that lack
            a parent Room. Note that orphaned Faces are not acceptable for
            Models that are to be exported for energy simulation.
        orphaned_shades: A list of the Shade objects in the model that lack
            a parent.
        orphaned_apertures: A list of the Aperture objects in the model that lack
            a parent Face. Note that orphaned Apertures are not acceptable for
            Models that are to be exported for energy simulation.
        orphaned_doors: A list of the Door objects in the model that lack

        tolerance: The maximum difference between x, y, and z values at which
            vertices are considered equivalent. Zero indicates that no tolerance

        angle_tolerance: The max angle difference in degrees that vertices are allowed
            to differ from one another in order to consider them colinear. Zero indicates
            that no angle tolerance checks should be performed. (Default: 1.0).
